## Features

- **Increment**: Increases the counter by 1.
- **Decrement**: Decreases the counter by 1.

These basic features serve as a good introduction to React, focusing on state management and user interaction.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Hooks**: `useState` for managing the counter state.
- **CSS**: For basic styling.

This project is designed to showcase fundamental React concepts and is easily extendable for more features.

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the app up and running locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/markuptitan/react-counter
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd react-counter
   ```

3. **Install project dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Once the app is running, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the counter in action.

## Usage

Once the app is running:

- **Increment**: Click the **Increase** button to increase the counter by 1.
- **Decrement**: Click the **Decrease** button to decrease the counter by 1.

The app is interactive, and you can use these buttons to test the counter's functionality.

## App Structure

The project structure is simple, designed to keep things modular and clean:

```
/react-counter
├── /public
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── favicon.svg
├── /src
│   ├── Counter.js
│   ├── App.js
│   ├── App.css
│   ├── index.js
└── package.json
```

### Key Files:

- `Counter.js`: Contains the logic for managing the counter (increment and decrement).
- `App.js`: The main React component that renders `Counter.js` and includes any additional functionality.
- `App.css`: The file where you define your app's styles.
- `favicon.svg`: The app icon used in the browser tab.

## Future Implementations

There are some future features and improvements planned for this app:

- **Dark Mode Toggle**: Implement a button that toggles between light and dark themes for a better user experience.
- **Accessibility Enhancements**: Improve accessibility by adding keyboard navigation and support for screen readers.
